In this project I experimented with line intersections (where one line intersects with another).
The lines are drawn between 2 points and the line that follows the cursor is also spinning.
This is handy in several other projects like the self driving car, for it's sensors (https://github.com/SamRotthier/SelfDrivingCar_JS).
